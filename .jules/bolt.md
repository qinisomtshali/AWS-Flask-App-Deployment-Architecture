**Learning:** In documentation-only repositories, image assets are the primary performance bottleneck. AI-generated images often contain large metadata chunks (like C2PA) that can be stripped without affecting visual quality, significantly reducing LCP.
**Action:** Always check WebP/PNG assets for metadata chunks using binary analysis before assuming they are fully optimized.
